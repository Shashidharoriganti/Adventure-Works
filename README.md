## 🔬 Project Overview 

This is a comprehensive data engineering project on the Azure cloud, where I handled data ingestion from an on-premise SQL Server to Azure Data Lake using Azure Data Factory. I performed transformations with Databricks and Spark, then loaded the data into Azure Synapse for reporting with Power BI. Additionally, I utilized Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Azure Key Vault for data monitoring and governance. 

### 💾 Dataset

**AdventureWorks** is a free database offered by Microsoft on online platforms. It was originally created as a sample database to showcase the design of a SQL Server database, specifically for SQL Server 2008. Here are some key details about AdventureWorks:

- The database represents a manufacturing multinational corporation called Adventure Works Cycles.
- It serves as a sample Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) database, which handles multiple concurrent transactions. Microsoft includes it with all their SQL Server products.

> For this project I used the **Lightweight (LT) data**: a lightweight and pared down version of the OLTP sample. [Download here](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorksLT2022.bak)

### 🎯 Project Goals

- Connect the on-premise SQL Server to the Azure cloud.
- Ingest tables into Azure Data Lake.
- Perform data cleaning and transformation using Azure Databricks.
- Use Azure Synapse Analytics to load the cleaned data.
- Develop interactive data visualizations and reports with Microsoft Power BI.
- Implement Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Azure Key Vault for monitoring and governance.

## 🕵️ Key Insights

- 💸 **Total Revenue by Product Category**
  - *Touring Bikes* is the top 1 category generating revenue with 32% followed by *Road Bikes* with 26% and *Mountain Bikes* with 24%.
 
- 🌍 **Sales by Country**
  - **N°1:** The United Kingdom (UK) have the most total sales with 278 and $572,000 of total revenue.
  - **N°2:** The United States of America (USA) is second with total sales with 264 and $383,810 of total revenue.

- 🚻 **Revenue by Gender**
  - 81% of the revenue is generated by Male customers
  - 19% of the revenue is generated by Female customers  

> This can be explained by males have more interest in doing outdoor activites with the different categories of Bikes than females.

### ⚙️ Data Transformation
- Mounted Azure Blob Storage to Databricks to retrieve raw data from the Data Lake.
- Used Spark Cluster in Azure Databricks to clean and refine the raw data.
- Saved the cleaned data in a Delta format; optimized for further analysis.

<a name="data-loading"></a>
### 📥 Data Loading
- Used Azure Synapse Analytics to load the refined data efficiently.
- Created SQL database and connected it to the data lake.
